Provide a diagram (e.g., docs/architecture.png) and a detailed description in docs/architecture.md of
the overall system architecture, including how components interact (e.g., Training DAG triggers MLflow
logging, Deployment DAG checks metrics and promotes model, FastAPI loads from MLflow, Drift DAG
monitors periodically). This visual/textual overview helps reviewers understand the end-to-end flow and
modularity.
